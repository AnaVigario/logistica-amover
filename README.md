The A-Mover Agenda aims to bring about a substantial change in the industrial development model in the Region of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro, through the realisation of a series of industrial investments that will allow the participating companies to enter international segments with high added value and a strong concern for global sustainability. As a result, a mobility services management platform is being developed that integrates technology in a compact and agile format.
